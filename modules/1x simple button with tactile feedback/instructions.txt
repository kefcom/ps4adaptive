Begin by bending the ground pin on the socket inward.
This is the pin that sticks out on the side of the socket.

Now apply some solder to the ground pin and the left audio channel pin.
The left audio channel pin is on the other side of the socket.

Test fit the button to check if it fits. Remove the button again and
apply some solder to two pins on the same side of the button.

Strip 2 wires and apply some solder to them.
Solder the wires to the button.

Now measure how long the wire needs to be between the socket and the button.
Beware that there is not much space for extra wire.

Cut the wires and strip them.
Apply some solder and solder the wires to the socket.

Now bend the left and right audio channel pins inward
(or better, cut the right audio channel pin as we don't need it).

Place the socket in the model making sure the socket is in the hole on the front.
place it as far forward as it goes.

Place the button. Make sure it's pins are not touching the socket's pins.

If you have a tester, you can now test the button and fix issues.

Place top cover and snap everything in place.

Place button cap.

Take a piece of velcro and hotglue it to the bottom making sure
the 'hook' side (the rough side) is facing down. The soft part should be touching
the button model.

Wait for it to cool and remove any excess glue if needed.

The button should be finished now.
