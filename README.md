# ps4adaptive

Welcome to the home of the ps4 adaptive controller github repository.
Here you can find every file to create your own controller and modules.


## Current version: 0.1 beta
## Supported PCB modelnumbers: 191105-v11, C1931

To get you started: Use the controller identifier document to figure out what type of pcb is in your controller, then go to the 'controller' folder and open the folder with that pcb version number.
Here you can find instructions, source files and a bill of materials.

I'm looking for support on this project! If you want to help out, shoot me a message! Designing better buttons would help out a lot, as wel as mapping out new pcb versions as they appear on the market.
